# STEGATO

Stegato was created as an application to rate all of your music.

After registering your account, you will be able to search and rate all music that is in the iTunes database. When your rating is submitted, that album is added to your music dashboard.

After rating an artist’s project, you can see on the leaderboard where your project ranks within the Stegato community leaderboard.

This application is powered by iTunes and last.fm API’s.

This application was designed as a capstone project while studying at Thinkful.
